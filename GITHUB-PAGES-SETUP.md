# ✅ ALMOST DONE! Final Step to Enable GitHub Pages

Your repository is created and all files are uploaded!
**Repository:** https://github.com/asa8118/optima-choice

## One More Step: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository:**
   https://github.com/asa8118/optima-choice

2. **Click "Settings"** (top menu bar)

3. **Click "Pages"** (left sidebar)

4. **Under "Source", select:**
   - Branch: **main**
   - Folder: **/ (root)**

5. **Click "Save"**

6. **Wait 2 minutes** for deployment

## Your URLs will be:

### QR Code Display (show this on screen during performance):
```
https://asa8118.github.io/optima-choice/optima-qr-code.html
```

### Landing Page (what students see when they scan):
```
https://asa8118.github.io/optima-choice/landing-page.html
```

## ✅ Test It!

After 2 minutes, open the QR code URL on your computer:
```
https://asa8118.github.io/optima-choice/optima-qr-code.html
```

Scan it with your phone - you should see the full Neurocian landing page!

## For Your Class of 20 Students:

1. **Display the QR code URL** on your projector during Act 2
2. **Students scan** with their phone cameras (no app needed)
3. **They see** the full "Optima Chip" registration experience
4. **Works anywhere** - they don't need same WiFi as you!

## Need Help?

If the page shows 404 after 2 minutes:
- Go back to Settings → Pages
- Make sure "main" branch is selected
- Try waiting another minute

If QR code doesn't scan:
- Make sure classroom lighting is good
- Zoom the browser to make QR code larger
- Check that your phone camera can see the whole code
